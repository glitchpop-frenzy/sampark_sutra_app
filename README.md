## Inspiration
The second Covid-19 wave in India has brought a very high amount of load onto our country's healthcare system. People have taken responsibility to inform others about different facilities available to people in need. My team member and myself thought of aggregating the data that is available and create an app for providing this information to the people in need.

## What it does
This app collects all the resources for Covid-19 treatment in India. The data for different facilities like oxygen distribution centers, plasma donors, hospital beds and medicines is collected by people using the app. The user has to login using their email and password to add any information to the database. Any user who has not logged in can see the different facilities that was reported by other users. The user can also call the hospital or donor by clicking on the __Call__ button.

## How we built it
Flutter, Firebase

## Challenges we ran into
- Initially we did not how to connect our Flutter app with Firebase. But, after 2 tutorials and a sleepless night, Saksham was able to connect our app with Firebase.
- We did not know how to implement authentication system in this app. We managed to create an email authentication screen for this app as we were not able to implement phone verification to this app.

## What we learned
- We learnt about Firebase as well as how authentication can be implemented using Firebase.

## What's next for Sampark Sutra App
- Create an online database for storing reported data.
- Create a better UI for the app
- Add feature for logged in user to add data to the app.
- Implement phone number authentication in the app.
